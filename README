TinyHAN - Tiny Home Area Network
--------------------------------

TinyHAN is a general purpose datagram oriented protocol for building sensor and control networks.
It is similar in concept to 802.15.4, but designed to work on ultra low cost hardware such
as radio modules from HopeRF (e.g. RFM22B, RFM69W).  Intended for domestic applications, there
is no support for meshing, reducing the code size dramatically.

The protocol adopts a layered design, with this library handling the physical and MAC layers.
PHY drivers are pluggable allowing interoperation between devices using different radios.  There
is also a test PHY using UDP multicast that enables the library to be tested on a Linux PC.

The MAC provides the following key features:

* Application datagram transmission with or without acknowledgement
* Automatic re-transmission of unacknowledged packets
* Support for two-way communication with sleeping (battery powered) nodes
* Per-packet validity period
* Automatic node registration and address assignment
* Monitoring of node presence (heartbeat) and signal strength, notification of node loss
* Optional periodic beacons to reduce transmission latency to sleeping nodes

Encryption and authentication are not supported in this version, but are on the roadmap as key
requirements.

Library
-------

The protocol is implemented as a platform-independent library targeting both small and large
embedded systems. A small platform abstraction layer is used to handle OS and hardware
dependencies.  Currently, the library is in-use on the following targets:

* Linux PC using the UDP demo PHY
* Atmel AVR ATMEGA328 (bare metal) with RFM23B radio
* STM32F407 running FreeRTOS, with RFM23B radio

Transports
----------

TinyHAN can carry any datagram based transport protocol (e.g. 6LoWPAN should be feasible).
Examples are included for:

* TinyHAN application protocol - a work-in-progress binary name/value pair protocol with
  extermely low software overhead designed for sensing and control applications
* MQTT-SN

Tools
-----

A GnuRadio tool is included to enable real-time debugging of a network by sniffing signals
off the air.  The tool works with low cost RTL-SDR dongles, or could be modified to
work with other SDRs such as HackRF or FCD.
